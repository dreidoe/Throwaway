I am **25** years old and from _Nashville, TN_. Born and raised in the area where I attended and graduated from [McGavock Comprehensive Highschool](https://mcgavock.mnps.org/) and gradeuated in 2015. After graduation, I  worked at a few local stores before joining the [US ARMY](https://www.goarmy.com/). After seperation from the military I had my frist son. I strted taking computer science courses. After a few semesters at a convention university, I then decided to drop the prerequisites, and start my coding career at _Claim Academy_. I decide to make the switch because, I found myslef getting frustrated with the difficulty level of some of my classes that had absolutely noting to do with my degree. I couldn't imagine how me remebering artist and the canvas they painted on would help me in my coding career. So i made the decison to switch to _Claim_ and begin my journey there.
